# Time-varying-cointegration

In this repository, it is contained the code I developed for my Master thesis project. The work is about applying the time-varying cointegration technique by Bierens and Martins to the crop production of Italy.
You will find:
- the python code, where I preprocessed data, performed EDA and applied stationarty tests and standard cointegration tests
- the R code, where I applied the time-varying technique.

Enojoy!
